Here we will examine how AdaSampling works on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, `brca`, from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and included as part of this package. For more information about the variables, try `?brca`. This dataset contains ten features, with an eleventh column containing the class labels, *malignant* or *benign*.
